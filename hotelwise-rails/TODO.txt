OBJECTIVE: Get booking (for logined user and specifc room type) working, staff can view can cancel booking

1. Enhance seed:
    -  add more rooms for each room type (except only one room for ocean view) 
    -  using dynamic date to seed booking data, check_in_date: Date.yesterday.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

	The purpose: the create easy to test scenarios
    * one room type with one room already books (oceanview)
		* one room type with mulitple rooms only one room available
	  * one room type with mulitple rooms, but no bookings for them at all
    * one romm with with multiple rooms all booked
		

2. Merge /search (view) to /bookings/new (view), i.e, Bookings#new will handle search

3. I implemented /reset (have a look at the def reset in WelcomeController), which resets the database to seeded; 

4. Write selenium automated tests (login as customer, logout, register customer, muiltple booking cases ..., staff login) in TestWise.
